In the world of insurance, specialty insurance is one of the fields of insurance where it faces a lot ofassets with complex risks. This causes the number of claims to be far fewer than the total claims fromother insurance markets, such as personal lines insurance and health insurance. Therefore, due to itsimbalance, it is a challenge to predict the claims of specialty insurance.This  paper  focuses  on  using  oversampling  methods  to  improve  the  performance  of  XGBoostmodels for claim prediction. There have been several researches about oversampling methods, whichinclude using random oversampling (ROS) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) tooversample the minority class. In this paper, we focus on using generative adversarial network (GAN) asthe oversampling method with ROS and SMOTE becoming the baseline methods. There are numeroustypes of GANs that exist and are used for oversampling purposes. In this paper, we focus on using vanillaGAN, conditional GAN (cGAN), Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and Wasserstein conditional GAN (WCGAN)to generate synthetic claim samples.
